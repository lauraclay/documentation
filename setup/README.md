# Setup / Quickstart

A quickstart guide to setting up your Raspberry Pi.

## What you will need

### Essential (for general use)

- [SD Card](../installation/sd-cards.md)
    - We recommend an 8GB class 4 SD card, ideally pre-installed with [NOOBS](../installation/noobs.md)
- [Display & connectivity cable](monitor-connection.md)
    - Any monitor or TV should work as a display for the Pi; a display with HDMI input is recommended, but other connections can be used.
- Keyboard and mouse
    - Any standard USB keyboard and mouse should work with the Pi.
    - Wireless keyboards and mice work, if already paired.
    - For keyboard layout configuration see [raspi-config](../configuration/raspi-config.md)
- [Power supply](../hardware/raspberrypi/power.md).
    - The Pi is powered by a USB Micro power supply, used in most standard mobile phone chargers.
    - You'll need a good quality power supply that can supply at least 700mA at 5V.
    - Low ampage (~700mA) power supplies will work for basic usage, but are likely to cause the Pi to reboot if it draws too much power.

### Optional

- Ethernet (network) cable [Model B only]
    - An ethernet cable is used to connect your Pi to a local network and the internet.
- [USB wireless dongle](../configuration/wireless/README.md)
    - Alternatively, you can connect to a wireless network using a USB wireless dongle; this requires configuration.
- Audio lead
    - Audio can be played through speakers or headphones, using a standard 3.5mm jack.
    - Without an HDMI cable, an audio lead is necessary to produce sound.
    - No separate audio lead is necessary if you're using an HDMI cable to connect your monitor, as audio can be played directly through the display. It is, however, possible to connect one to play the audio through other speakers; this requires [configuration](../configuration/audio-config.md).

## Troubleshooting

For any issues during setup, see the [troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/README.md) section.
